 I have created a Travel Agency landing page as part of a web development practice. This project showcases my skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and features an interactive and responsive design suitable for various screen sizes. Below are the details of the files used and what I learned from this project.

Files Used:
1. index.html:

This file contains the structure of the webpage, including the header, navigation menu, main content sections, and footer.
The navigation menu includes links to different sections of the page, such as Home, Services, About, and Contact.

2. utils.css:

This file includes utility classes for common styles such as margin, padding, text alignment, and other reusable CSS properties.
These utility classes help in maintaining a clean and efficient codebase by avoiding repetition.

3. style.css:

This file contains the main styling rules for the landing page.
It defines the layout, colors, fonts, and responsive design for various sections of the page.
Key features include:
A sticky navigation bar that changes color when the user scrolls.
Sections with distinct designs and color schemes.
Responsive design adjustments for different screen sizes, including specific media queries for 2560px and smaller screens.

4. script.js:

This file adds interactivity to the landing page using JavaScript.
It handles the dynamic behavior of the navigation menu, such as changing the background color and font color on scroll and hover.
It also includes event listeners for user interactions with the navigation menu.
